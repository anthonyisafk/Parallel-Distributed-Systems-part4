# Parallel-Distributed-Systems-part4

Repository containing all the work and tests we did for the 4th and final assignment of the Parallel and Distributed Systems course. Our report was conducted on the comparison of the **pthreads**, **OpenCilk**, and **MultiCilk**(combining the former) threading schemes.

The schemes were compared using a simple *producer-consumer* approach on arrays that mathematical operations need to be applied on.

More information about the producer-consumer problem with the `axpy` operation can be found in the [report file](tex/Template.pdf) we have sketched together.
